Historical foundations
The field of reinforcement learning (RL) studies how an agent learns to act by interacting with an environment and maximizing a reward signal. Early work was influenced by control theory and psychology; the Bellman optimality equations formalized Markov decision processes (MDPs) and value functions. In the 1950s–1970s researchers used dynamic programming to compute optimal policies when the system model is known[1].
Temporal‑difference and Q‑learning
In situations where the transition model is unknown, temporal‑difference (TD) methods estimate value functions from experience. Q‑learning (1989) is an off‑policy TD algorithm that updates action‑values using one‑step bootstrapping[2]. Q‑learning’s tabular form becomes infeasible for large state spaces. SARSA and TD(λ) add eligibility traces or on‑policy updates[3], providing incremental improvements.
Function approximation and early neural RL
To handle large state spaces, researchers used function approximators. Linear function approximation and engineered features worked for some robotic and finance tasks[4]. In the 1990s, neuro‑dynamic programming combined TD learning with neural networks. Tesauro’s TD‑Gammon used a multilayer perceptron to play backgammon near human level, but training was unstable due to correlated data and non‑stationary targets[5].
Deep RL and value‑based methods
Deep Q‑network (DQN)
The deep Q‑network (DQN), introduced by DeepMind in 2013 and popularized in 2015, was a turning point. DQN combines Q‑learning with convolutional neural networks to process raw pixel inputs. Two stabilization techniques—experience replay and a target network—make training more stable[6]. DQN achieved human‑level performance on Atari games[7] and showed that end‑to‑end learning from images is possible.
Extensions of DQN
Numerous variants improved on DQN:
•	Double DQN reduces over‑estimation bias by decoupling action selection from evaluation[8].
•	Dueling DQN separates value and advantage streams to better estimate state values when the choice of action matters little[8].
•	Prioritized replay samples transitions with high TD error more often to correct large errors[9].
•	Rainbow DQN combines several improvements (double DQN, dueling networks, prioritized replay, multi‑step returns, distributional RL, noisy nets)[10] and remains a strong baseline.
Despite their success, Q‑learning–based methods can struggle in continuous action spaces and require large amounts of experience[11], prompting interest in direct policy optimization.
Policy‑gradient and actor–critic methods
Policy‑gradient algorithms
Instead of deriving a policy from value estimates, policy‑gradient methods directly parameterize and optimize the policy. REINFORCE (1992) updates policy parameters using the gradient of expected returns[12]. Baselines and variance‑reduction techniques were introduced in the late 1990s to address the high variance of naive policy‑gradient estimates[13].
Actor–critic frameworks
Actor–critic methods combine policy‑gradient (actor) and value‑function estimation (critic) to reduce variance. Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic (A3C, 2016) runs many parallel workers to decorrelate data. Each worker interacts with its own environment, computes gradients and periodically updates a global network[14]. A3C accelerated training and inspired large‑scale frameworks such as IMPALA.
Trust‑region and proximal policy optimization
Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO, 2015) constrains the size of policy updates using a KL‑divergence trust region[15] but is computationally heavy. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO, 2017) simplifies TRPO by clipping the probability ratio between old and new policies, preventing overly large policy updates[16]. PPO’s balance of stability and simplicity has made it a widely used algorithm. OpenAI used PPO to train a robotic hand to manipulate a Rubik’s Cube in the real world[17], and PPO is also employed in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align large language models[18].
Soft Actor–Critic
Soft Actor–Critic (SAC, 2018) incorporates maximum‑entropy RL into the actor–critic framework, encouraging stochastic policies. SAC uses two Q‑networks, an entropy‑regularization temperature and an off‑policy replay buffer[19]. It achieves state‑of‑the‑art performance on continuous‑control benchmarks like HalfCheetah and Hopper, offering stable convergence and improved exploration[20].
Model‑based and planning‑based RL
Early model‑based methods and tree search
Model‑based RL learns or uses a model of environment dynamics to plan actions. Dyna‑Q (1990) combines learning a model with Q‑learning and uses the model to simulate experiences[21]. Planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was central to AlphaGo, which combined deep policy and value networks with MCTS to defeat human champions[22]. AlphaZero generalized this approach to chess and shogi[23]. MuZero (2019) learned a latent‑space model of environment dynamics and reward without knowing the true rules[24], achieving strong performance on board games and Atari.
World models and Dreamer
World‑model methods learn a compact latent representation of the environment and use imagination to plan future actions. Ensemble world models quantify uncertainty, while residual models combine known physics with learned residuals[25]. The Dreamer family of algorithms learns latent dynamics and improves behaviour by planning in imagination. DreamerV3 (2025) uses normalization and balancing techniques to achieve robust learning across more than 150 diverse tasks without tuning[26]. It is the first algorithm to collect diamonds in the video game Minecraft from scratch, demonstrating that a general world‑model agent with fixed hyper‑parameters can solve diverse control problems[26].
Hybrid approaches and challenges
Hybrid methods combine model‑free and model‑based techniques. Ensembles and world models reduce sample requirements[27]. However, model accuracy vs. planning horizon, computational overhead and generalization remain challenges[28].
Hierarchical RL and evolutionary strategies
Evolutionary strategies (ES) treat policy parameters as black‑box variables and evolve a population of solutions via mutation and selection. Modern ES implementations leverage massive parallelism and can compete with gradient‑based methods on tasks like Atari[29], but they often require many evaluations.
Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) decomposes complex tasks into subtasks. Early work introduced FeUdal RL, where high‑level managers issue goals to low‑level workers[30]. The options framework formalizes temporally extended actions[31]. Recent HRL approaches such as the option‑critic architecture learn both intra‑option policies and termination conditions[32]. HRL has been effective in tasks requiring long‑horizon planning, like resource gathering in Minecraft and multi‑stage robot manipulation[33].
Recent innovations and emerging directions
Transformer‑based and offline RL methods
Inspired by progress in large language models, researchers have applied transformers to RL. The Decision Transformer (DT) (2021) treats return‑conditioned policy learning as a sequence‑modeling problem. However, recent studies show that simple filtered behavior cloning can match or outperform DT on some sparse‑reward tasks[34]. Extensions include the Trajectory Transformer, Behavior Transformer and Q‑Transformer[35]. Transformer‑based models are particularly popular in offline RL, where agents learn from fixed datasets without online interactions. Offline methods such as Conservative Q‑Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q‑Learning (IQL) address distributional shift and over‑estimation by regularizing value estimates.
Generalist and multimodal agents
Large‑scale multitask agents aim to handle diverse modalities and embodiments. DeepMind’s Gato (2022) is a single transformer that can play Atari games, caption images, chat and manipulate a real robot arm using the same network weights[36]. Gato shows that a unified policy conditioned on context can operate across text, images and low‑level control outputs.
Google’s RT‑1 Robotics Transformer trains a transformer policy on a large collection of robot trajectories and demonstrates strong zero‑shot generalization to new tasks, objects and environments. The RT‑1 abstract argues that generalization in robotics benefits from open‑ended, task‑agnostic training and high‑capacity architectures[37]. RT‑1 tokenizes images, language instructions and actions and shows that the model can learn from heterogeneous real‑world data and perform long‑horizon tasks when coupled with language‑guided planning (SayCan)[37].
Reinforcement learning with human or AI feedback
To align large models with human preferences, researchers use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A reward model is learned from comparisons of model outputs provided by human annotators, and the policy is optimized (often with PPO) to maximize the reward model[18]. RLHF is widely used to fine‑tune large language models such as ChatGPT. More recent work on reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) aims to replace or augment human feedback with AI heuristics or programmatic checks.
Large‑scale multi‑agent and self‑play systems
Self‑play has been a powerful paradigm in multi‑agent environments. DeepMind’s AlphaStar used multi‑agent reinforcement learning and self‑play to achieve Grandmaster level in StarCraft II. Offline versions like AlphaStar Unplugged provide benchmarks for offline RL research in complex domains[38]. OpenAI Five employed large‑scale PPO training with self‑play to beat professional Dota 2 teams. These systems show that scalable RL with self‑play and population‑based training can master highly complex, partially observable environments.

Key trends and future directions
•	Generalization and efficiency: Modern research seeks agents that generalize across tasks and environments without extensive hyper‑parameter tuning. World‑model approaches (e.g., DreamerV3) and transformer‑based policies show progress toward this goal[26]. Sample‑efficient algorithms are critical for robotics, healthcare and finance[39].
•	Safety and alignment: As RL agents are deployed in the real world and used to train large models, ensuring safety, robustness and alignment with human values is increasingly important. RLHF, RLAIF and RLVR explore ways to incorporate human or formal feedback to guide learning[18].
•	Scalability and computation: Large‑scale multi‑agent systems (AlphaStar, OpenAI Five) demonstrate that performance can continue to scale with more compute and data. However, the energy cost and carbon footprint of training large RL models raise sustainability concerns.
•	Interdisciplinary integration: RL is merging with other areas such as generative models (e.g., diffusion‑guided RL for robotics), causal inference, and self‑supervised learning. Combining RL with unsupervised representation learning may yield agents that generalize better and require fewer labels.
The landscape of reinforcement learning has expanded dramatically since the advent of DQN. From classical TD and value‑based methods to sophisticated policy optimization, world‑model planning, transformers, and human‑aligned training, the diversity of RL algorithms continues to grow. Recent methods focus on improving stability, sample efficiency and generalization, bringing RL closer to practical deployment in complex real‑world domains.
